# Hydrant Template Engine

*Hydrant* is a template class for CodeIgniter 2 PHP framework based on underestimated (in my opinion) [Rain Template Engine](http://www.raintpl.com).

Some modification will be done to achieve maximum integration with CI codebase (caching, for example) (and yes, I'm not scared by evil coupling) so it has to be considered a fork/derivative work, not a wrapper for original class.

I aim to maintain full compatibility with Rain syntax even for future versions of the library.
The main part of the codebase is taken directly by Rain class, so please, praise Rain Team if you find this useful.

So far, you could refer to RainTPL site to learn about usage.
*More to come*
